# Contributing to reverse-engineer

Thank you for considering a contribution! This project is open source under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## How to contribute

1. **Open an issue first** for substantial changes. Quick bugfixes or doc tweaks can go straight to a PR.
2. **Fork**, branch from `main`, make your change.
3. **Bump version** per the [versioning policy](README.md#versioning-policy).
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with a new `[X.Y.Z]` entry.
5. **Add author attribution** to any new file (HTML comment block — see existing files for the pattern).
6. **Run `claude plugin validate`** before opening the PR.
7. **Open the PR** using the [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md).

## Code style

- Markdown for skills / agents / templates; bash + Python for `bin/` and the `tests/` harness.
- YAML frontmatter on all skill / agent / template files.
- Every file ends with a Revision Log section (templates only) and a "Skillfully made with…" footer (templates only).
- Author attribution at the top of every text file. Shell/Python files use a bash-comment header (shebang → `# Author:` / `# License:` / `# Project:`).
- Run `bash tests/run_all.sh` (must end with "All tests passed") and `shellcheck` on changed shell scripts before opening a PR.

## Local development

This repo is its own marketplace. To install your in-progress changes locally:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update alexfordlabs
claude plugin uninstall reverse-engineer@alexfordlabs
claude plugin install reverse-engineer@alexfordlabs
/reload-plugins
```

To run the automated test suite: `bash tests/run_all.sh`.
